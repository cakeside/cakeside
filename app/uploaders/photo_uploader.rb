  # process :scale => [200, 300]

  # Create different versions of your uploaded files:
  version :thumb do

  # Add a white list of extensions which are allowed to be uploaded.
  # For images you might use something like this:
  def extension_white_list
    %w(jpg jpeg gif png)

  # Avoid using model.id or version_name here, see uploader/store.rb for details.
